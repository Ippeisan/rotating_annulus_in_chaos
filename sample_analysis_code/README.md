This folder contains sample analysis codes used for Figs. 3, 4 and 10.

## Folder: fig3

This folder includes MATLAB source code for visualizing the temperature variation in the azimuthal and temporal directions.

## Folder: fig4

This folder includes MATLAB source code for illustrating the time evolution of the temperature oscillation for wave number 3.

## Folder: fig10

This folder includes the C++ and MATLAB source codes.

* "**profile.cc**" calculates the maximum and minimum values of $\Gamma$ and $\mathcal{R}$ in each $\delta$. The obtained data is stored in "profile2_dat2.dat".
* "**plot_duty.m**" generates two figures: one showing the maximum and minimum $\Gamma$ for each $\delta$, and the other displaying $\mathcal{R}$ for each $\delta$.
